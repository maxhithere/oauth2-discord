# oauth2-discord

## code for using discord oauth2 with express.js & mongo db

 this was made for the purpose of https://bloxy.digital/ but it is also open source.
 this was possible due to `passport` and `passport-discord` : https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport & https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-discord
 
 this oauth2 example uses mongo db for storing user data, but any database can be used
 
 Packages: `dotenv, express, express-session, mongoose, passport, passport-discord`
 
 ### if you want to make a pr please test your code beforehand to make sure it works and that the feature you are implementing is actually useful.
